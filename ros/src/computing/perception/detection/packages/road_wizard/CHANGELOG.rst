1.3.0 (2017-07-14)
------------------
* fix build issues due to autoware_msgs
* Resolved merge conflict by new feature
* Add link of trained data for tlr
* Merge branch 'develop' into feature/TLR_by_machine_learning

  * Add UI to boot `traffic_light_recognition_ssd.launch` from runtime-manager
* Update state_transition_matrix
* Fix bug of vector_map_server usage
* Re-implement filter of signal orientation
  Target traffic light should face to camera.
  In this modification, target light will be chosen if it faces to camera +- 50 degree in camera coordinate system
* Apply vector_map_server function
* Fix usage of std::string::substr
* Modify State Transition Matrix of TLR for more precise recognition
  * w.r.t `region_tlr`, just fixed comment
  * w.r.t `region_tlr_ssd`, applied manner of erring on the side of caution

  And fixed small bug to get parameter from ROS private parameter server

* Add filter not to save similar images
* Modify output format in VOC data one
  * Change the directory structure
  * Output each annotation file separately in XML format
  * Add position coordinate of traffic light in a image into annotation
* Add base function of label_maker
  This version outputs label data into one CSV file.
  Label data only contains file name and its traffic light states.
  We need improve output data label format to apply RCNN easily.
* Add roi_extractor node
* Move context-regarding files as package header and library
* Extract context operations as class method for future shared-use
* convert to autoware_msgs

* fix circular-dependency
* ROS Kinectic Upgrade tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and OpenCV 3.2.0
  Modules not included:
  -orb_localizer
  -dpm_ocv node and lib
  Everything else working
  Added some libraries for Gazebo on src/extras
* Update for kinetic
* Contributors: Shohei Fujii, Yukihiro Saito, Yusuke FUJII, amc-nu

1.0.0 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#452 <https://github.com/CPFL/Autoware/issues/452>`_ from CPFL/add-vector_map-library
  Add vector map library
* Fix codes to use map_file messages and old vector_map_info topics
* Publish the detection result when it is different from the previous one
* Modify region_tlr so that it publishes superimpose image as topic
  Superimpose result image is now available as topic named
  "/tlr_superimpose_image"
* Uncomment publish statement of region_tlr
  Now region_tlr node publishes "light_color" topic
  as traffic light recognition result which is
  subscribed by traffic_light_viewer
* Runtime Manager, update feat_proj for SIGINT termination
* Uncomment publish statement of region_tlr
  Now region_tlr node publishes "light_color" topic
  as traffic light recognition result which is
  subscribed by traffic_light_viewer
* Add module graph tool
* Modify to get camera ID from runtime manager
  * Make it possible to obtain camera ID in each node to subscribe topics
  under camera name space selectively
  * Get image size from sensor_msgs::Image instead of CameraInfo
* Merge branch 'master' of ssh://localhost:8443/CPFL/Autoware into apply_multi_camera

  ros/src/util/packages/runtime_manager/scripts/vscan.launch
* Eigen3 with Fallback on ros-catkin-modules
* Change frame ID according to used camera
* Modify launch files to specify source camera
* Add condition to ignore signals not for cars
* Add ifdef to control showing debug information
* Make camera_info source selectable
  I modified nodes that subscribe /camera/camera_info
  so that we can specify the topic name from launch file
* Make image source selectable from launch file
  In order to use multiple camera, I modified
  - all viewers
  - some cv_tracker's packages and a library
  - lane_detector package
  - some road_wizard package
  so that input image topic can be changed easily from launch file
* Remove sound player execution from traffic_light_recognition.launch
* Clean up Qt5 configuration
  Use pkg-config as possible instead of absolute pathes.
* Use c++11 option instead of c++0x
  We can use newer compilers which support 'c++11' option
* Update region_tlr
  - Add area-size condition to remove false detection caused by background
  in ROI
  - Update STATE_TRANSITION_MATRIX so that state will be UNDEFINED if
  impossible state change happens
  - minor fix
* Update threshold
  Increased threshold value with regard to update state of detected
  traffic light color
* Fix traffic_light_detection
  I modified traffic_light_detection so that fragmented signal lamps are
  assembled in a context by its poleID
* Modified region_tlr so that we can switch displaying image of superimpose result
  And this commit achieves
  - resizable image window showing superimpose result,
  - making close button on the window usable
* Modified feat_proj so that we can adjust projection error from runtime manger
* Initial commit for public release
