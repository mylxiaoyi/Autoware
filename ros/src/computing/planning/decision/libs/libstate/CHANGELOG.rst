1.5.1 (2017-09-25)
------------------

1.5.0 (2017-09-21)
------------------
* apply clang-format
* Add to support dynamical parameter for decision_maker
* Fix a build error for libstate
* Move the decision part of the state machine library to decision_Maker node. This is WIP.
* Fixed configuration of state
* apply clang-format
* organize package files and directories
* Add a decision_maker package
  The decision_maker package determines the intention of what actions the
  local planner and control node should take based on perception nodes,
  global planner nodes, map data, sensor data.
  This commit corresponds only to the following functions.
  - Behavior state recognition
  - Dynamic selection of local planner (It is necessary to change the topic name of local planner)
